(1) during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities thereof; and

SEC. 102. BARRIERS TO AND OTHER DISTORTIONS OF TRADE.
(a) The Congress finds that barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade are reducing the growth of foreign markets for the products of United States agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, diminishing the intended mutual benefits of reciprocal trade concessions, adversely affecting the United States economy, preventing fair and equitable access to supplies, and preventing the development of open and nondiscriminatory trade among nations. The President is urged to take all appropriate and feasible steps within his power (including the full exercise of the rights of the United States under international agreements) to harmonize, re- duce, or eliminate such barriers to (and other distortions of) inter- national trade. The President is further urged to utilize the author- ity granted by subsection (b) to negotiate trade agreements with other countries and instrumentalities providing on a basis of mutu- ality for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of such bar- riers to (and other distortions of) international trade. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prior approval of any legisla- tion which may be necessary to implement an agreement con- cerning barriers to (or other distortions of) international trade.
(b)(1) Whenever the President determines that any barriers to (or other distortions of) international trade of any foreign country or the United States unduly burden and restrict the foreign trade of the United States or adversely affect the United States economy, or that the imposition of such barriers is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect, and that the purposes of this Act will be promoted thereby, the President, during the 13-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities pro- viding for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of such bar- riers (or other distortions) of providing for the prohibition of or lim- itations on the imposition of such barriers (or other distortions).
(2)(A) Trade agreements that provide for the elimination or re- duction of any duty imposed by the United States may be entered into under paragraph (1) only with Israel.
(B) The negotiation of any trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with Israel that provides for the elimination or re- duction of any duty imposed by the United States shall take fully into account any product that benefits from a discriminatory pref-

(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the re- quirements of subsections (c) and (e)(1) shall not apply to any trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with Israel that pro- vides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States.
(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no trade ben- efit shall be extended to any country by reason of the extension of any trade benefit to another country under a trade agreement en- tered into under paragraph (1) with such other country that pro- vides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States.
(4)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), a trade agreement that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States may be entered into under paragraph (1) with any country other than Israel if—
(i) such country requested the negotiation of such an agreement, and
(ii) the President, at least 60 days prior to the date notice is provided under subsection (e)(1)—
(I) provides written notice of such negotiations to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and
(II) consults with such committees regarding the nego- tiation of such agreement.
(B) The provisions of section 151 shall not apply to an imple- menting bill (within the meaning of section 151(b)) if—
(i) such implementing bill contains a provision approving of any trade agreement which—
(I) is entered into under this section with any country other than Israel, and
(II) provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States, and
(ii) either—
(I) the requirements of subparagraph (A) were not met with respect to the negotiation of such agreement, or
(II) the Committee on Finance of the Senate or the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Represent- atives disapproved of the negotiation of such agreement before the close of the 60-day period which begins on the date notice is provided under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) with respect to the negotiation of such agreement.
(C) The 60-day period described under paragraphs (A)(ii) and (B)(ii)(II) shall be computed without regard to—
(i) the days on which either House of Congress is not in session because of an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain or an adjournment of the Congress sine die, and
(ii) any Saturday and Sunday, not excluded under clause (i), when either House of Congress is not in session.

Sec. 102 TRADE ACT OF 1974 8
(c) Before the President enters into any trade agreement under this section providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimi- nation of a barrier to (or other distortion of) international trade, he shall consult with the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Finance of the Senate, and with each committee of the House and the Senate and each joint committee of the Congress which has jurisdiction over legislation involving subject matters which would be affected by such trade agreement. Such consultation shall include all matters relating to the implementation of such trade agreement as provided in sub- sections (d) and (e). If it is proposed to implement such trade agree- ment, together with one or more other trade agreements entered into under this section, in a single implementing bill, such con- sultation shall include the desirability and feasibility of such pro- posed implementation.
(d) Whenever the President enters into a trade agreement under this section providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of a barrier to (or other distortion of) international trade, he shall submit such agreement, together with a draft of an implementing bill (described in section 151(b)) and a statement of any administrative action proposed to implement such agreement, to the Congress as provided in subsection (e), and such agreement shall enter into force with respect to the United States only if the provisions of subsection (e) are complied with and the imple- menting bill submitted by the President is enacted into law.
(e) Each trade agreement submitted to the Congress under this subsection shall enter into force with respect to the United States if (and only if)—
(1) the President, not less than 90 days before the day on which he enters into such trade agreement, notifies the House of Representatives and the Senate of his intention to enter into such an agreement, and promptly thereafter publishes notice of such intention in the Federal Register;
(2) after entering into the agreement, the President trans- mits a document to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing a copy of the final legal text of such agree- ment together with—
(A) a draft of an implementing bill and a statement of any administrative action proposed to implement such agreement, and an explanation as to how the imple- menting bill and proposed administrative action change or affect existing law, and
(B) a statement of his reasons as to how the agree- ment serves the interests of United States commerce and as to why the implementing bill and proposed administra- tive action is required or appropriate to carry out the agreement; and
(3) the implementing bill is enacted into law.
(f) To insure that a foreign country or instrumentality which receives benefits under a trade agreement entered into under this section is subject to the obligations imposed by such agreement, the President may recommend to Congress in the implementing bill and statement of administrative action submitted with respect to such agreement that the benefits and obligations of such agree-

SEC. 103. OVERALL NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVE.
The overall United States negotiating objective under sections 101 and 102 shall be to obtain more open and equitable market ac- cess and the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of devices which distort trade or commerce.

(b) As a means of achieving the negotiating objective set forth in subsection (a), to the extent consistent with the objective of maximizing overall economic benefit to the United States (through maintaining and enlarging foreign markets for products of United States agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, through the development of fair and equitable market opportunities, and through open and nondiscriminatory world trade), negotiations shall, to the extent feasible be conducted on the basis of appro- priate product sectors of manufacturing.

(1) a reduction of 3 percent ad valorem or a reduction of one-tenth of the total reduction, whichever is greater, had taken effect on the effective date of the first reduction pro- claimed pursuant to section 101(a)(2) to carry out such agree- ment with respect to such article, and

There are authorized to be appropriated annually such sums as may be necessary for the payment by the United States of its share of the expenses of the Contracting Parties to the General Agree- ment on Tariffs and Trade. This authorization does not imply ap- proval or disapproval by the Congress of all articles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

SEC. 122. BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS AUTHORITY.
(a) Whenever fundamental international payments problems require special import measures to restrict imports—
(1) to deal with large and serious United States balance- of-payments deficits,
(2) to prevent an imminent and significant depreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, or
(3) to cooperate with other countries in correcting an inter- national balance-of-payments disequilibrium,
the President shall proclaim, for a period not exceeding 150 days (unless such period is extended by Act of Congress)—
(A) a temporary import surcharge, not to exceed 15 percent ad valorem, in the form of duties (in addition to those already imposed, if any) on articles imported into the United States;
(B) temporary limitations through the use of quotas on the importation of articles into the United States; or
(C) both a temporary import surcharge described in subparagraph (A) and temporary limitations described in subparagraph (B).
The authority delegated under subparagraph (B) (and so much of subparagraph (C) as relates to subparagraph (B)) may be exercised (i) only if international trade or monetary agreements to which the United States is a party permit the imposition of quotas as a bal- ance-of-payments measure, and (ii) only to the extent that the fun- damental imbalance cannot be dealt with effectively by a surcharge proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (C). Any temporary import surcharge proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (C) shall be treated as a regular customs duty.
(b) If the President determines that the imposition of import restrictions under subsection (a) will be contrary to the national in- terest of the United States, then he may refrain from proclaiming such restrictions and he shall—
(1) immediately inform Congress of his determination, and
(2) immediately convene the group of congressional official advisers designated under section 161(a) and consult with them as to the reasons for such determination.

(1) to deal with large and persistent United States bal- ance-of-trade surpluses, as determined on the basis of the cost- insurance-freight value of imports, as reported by the Bureau of the Census, or
(2) to prevent significant appreciation of the dollar in for- eign exchange markets.
the President is authorized to proclaim, for a period of 150 days (unless such period is extended by Act of Congress)—
(A) a temporary reduction (of not more than 5 percent ad valorem) in the rate of duty on any article; and
(B) a temporary increase in the value or quantity of arti- cles which may be imported under any import restriction, or a temporary suspension of any import restriction.
Import liberalizing actions proclaimed pursuant to this subsection shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except that the President shall not proclaim measures under this subsection with respect to those articles where in his judgment such action will cause or contribute to material injury to firms or workers in any domestic industry, including agriculture, mining, fishing, or commerce, or to impairment of the national se- curity, or will otherwise be contrary to the national interest.
(d)(1) Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to sub- section (a) shall be applied consistently with the principle of non- discriminatory treatment. In addition, any quota proclaimed pursu- ant to subparagraph (B) of subsection (a) shall be applied on a basis which aims at a distribution of trade with the United States approaching as closely as possible that which various foreign coun- tries might have expected to obtain in the absence of such restric- tions.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the President determines that the purposes of this section will best be served by action against one or more countries having large or persistent balance- of-payments surpluses, he may exempt all other countries from such action.
(3) After such time when there enters into force for the United States new rules regarding the application of surcharges as part of a reform of internationally agreed balance-of-payments adjustment procedures, the exemption authority contained in paragraph (2) shall be applied consistently with such new international rules.
(4) It is the sense of Congress that the President seek modifica- tions in international agreements aimed at allowing the use of sur- charges in place of quantitative restrictions (and providing rules to govern the use of such surcharges) as a balance-of-payments ad- justment measure within the context of arrangements for an equi- table sharing of balance-of-payments adjustment responsibility among deficit and surplus countries.
(e) Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to sub- section (a) shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except where the President determines, consist- ently with the purposes of this section, that certain articles should not be subject to import restricting actions because of the needs of the United States economy. Such exceptions shall be limited to the unavailability of domestic supply at reasonable prices, the nec-

Neither the authorization of import restricting actions nor the determination of exceptions with respect to product coverage shall be made for the purpose of protecting individual domestic in- dustries from import competition.
(f) Any quantitative limitation proclaimed pursuant to sub- paragraph (B) or (C) of subsection (a) on the quantity or value, or both, of an article—
(1) shall permit the importation of a quantity or value which is not less than the quantity or value of such article im- ported into the United States from the foreign countries to which such limitation applies during the most recent period which the President determines is representative of imports of such article, and
(2) shall take into account any increase since the end of such representative period in domestic consumption of such ar- ticle and like or similar articles of domestic manufacture or production.

(B) For purposes of this section, the term ‘‘substantial
cause’’ means a cause which is important and not less than any other cause.
(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Com- mission shall make the determination under paragraph (1) within 120 days (180 days if the petition alleges that critical circumstances exist) after the date on which the petition is filed, the request or resolution is received, or the motion is adopted, as the case may be.

(C) with respect to substantial cause, an increase in
imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) and a decline in the proportion of the domestic market supplied by domestic producers.
(2) In making determinations under subsection (b), the
Commission shall—
(A) consider the condition of the domestic industry
over the course of the relevant business cycle, but may not aggregate the causes of declining demand associated with a recession or economic downturn in the United States economy into a single cause of serious injury or threat of injury; and
(B) examine factors other than imports which may be a cause of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, to the domestic industry.
The Commission shall include the results of its examination under subparagraph (B) in the report submitted by the Com- mission to the President under subsection (e).
(3) The presence or absence of any factor which the Com- mission is required to evaluate in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) is not necessarily dispositive of whether an ar- ticle is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry.
(4) For purposes of subsection (b), in determining the do- mestic industry producing an article like or directly competi- tive with an imported article, the Commission—
(A) to the extent information is available, shall, in the case of a domestic producer which also imports, treat as part of such domestic industry only its domestic produc- tion;
(B) may, in the case of a domestic producer which pro- duces more than one article, treat as part of such domestic industry only that portion or subdivision of the producer which produces the like or directly competitive article; and
(C) may, in the case of one or more domestic producers which produce a like or directly competitive article in a major geographic area of the United States and whose pro- duction facilities in such area for such article constitute a substantial portion of the domestic industry in the United

States and primarily serve the market in such area, and where the imports are concentrated in such area, treat as such domestic industry only that segment of the produc- tion located in such area.
(5) In the course of any proceeding under this subsection, the Commission shall investigate any factor which in its judg- ment may be contributing to increased imports of the article under investigation. Whenever in the course of its investiga- tion the Commission has reason to believe that the increased imports are attributable in part to circumstances which come within the purview of subtitles A and B of title VII or section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, or other remedial provisions of law, the Commission shall promptly notify the appropriate agency so that such action may be taken as is otherwise au- thorized by such provisions of law.
(6) For purposes of this section:
(A)(i) The term ‘‘domestic industry’’ means, with re-
spect to an article, the producers as a whole of the like or directly competitive article or those producers whose col- lective production of the like or directly competitive article constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic pro- duction of such article.
(ii) The term ‘‘domestic industry’’ includes producers located in the United States insular possessions.
(B) The term ‘‘significant idling of productive facilities’’ includes the closing of plants or the underutilization of production capacity.
(C) The term ‘‘serious injury’’ means a significant over- all impairment in the position of a domestic industry.
(D) The term ‘‘threat of serious injury’’ means serious injury that is clearly imminent.
(d) PROVISIONAL RELIEF.—
(1)(A) An entity representing a domestic industry that pro-
duces a perishable agricultural product or citrus product that is like or directly competitive with an imported perishable agri- cultural product or citrus product may file a request with the Trade Representative for the monitoring of imports of that product under subparagraph (B). Within 21 days after receiv- ing the request, the Trade Representative shall determine if—
(i) the imported product is a perishable agricultural product or citrus product; and
(ii) there is a reasonable indication that such product is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be, or likely to be, a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to such domestic in- dustry.
(B) If the determinations under subparagraph (A) (i) and
(ii) are affirmative, the Trade Representative shall request, under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the Commission to monitor and investigate the imports concerned for a period not to exceed 2 years. The monitoring and investigation may include the collection and analysis of information that would expedite an investigation under subsection (b).
(C) If a petition filed under subsection (a)—

(i) alleges injury from imports of a perishable agricul- tural product or citrus product that has been, on the date the allegation is included in the petition, subject to moni- toring by the Commission under subparagraph (B) for not less than 90 days; and
(ii) requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to such imports;
the Commission shall, not later than the 21st day after the day on which the request was filed, make a determination, on the basis of available information, whether increased imports (ei- ther actual or relative to domestic production) of the perishable agricultural product or citrus product are a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic indus- try producing a like or directly competitive perishable product or citrus product, and whether either—
(I) the serious injury is likely to be difficult to repair by reason of perishability of the like or directly competitive agricultural product; or
(II) the serious injury cannot be timely prevented through investigation under subsection (b) and action under section 203.
(D) At the request of the Commission, the Secretary of Ag-
riculture shall promptly provide to the Commission any rel- evant information that the Department of Agriculture may have for purposes of making determinations and findings under this subsection.
(E) Whenever the Commission makes an affirmative pre- liminary determination under subparagraph (C), the Commis- sion shall find the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. In car- rying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall give pref- erence to increasing or imposing a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the seri- ous injury.
(F) The Commission shall immediately report to the Presi- dent its determination under subparagraph (C) and, if the de- termination is affirmative, the finding under subparagraph (E).
(G) Within 7 days after receiving a report from the Com- mission under subparagraph (F) containing an affirmative de- termination, the President, if he considers provisional relief to be warranted and after taking into account the finding of the Commission under subparagraph (E), shall proclaim such pro- visional relief that the President considers necessary to pre- vent or remedy the serious injury.
(2)(A) When a petition filed under subsection (a) alleges that critical circumstances exist and requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to imports of the article identified in the petition, the Commission shall, not later than 60 days after the petition containing the request was filed, determine, on the basis of available information, whether—
(i) there is clear evidence that increased imports (ei- ther actual or relative to domestic production) of the arti-

(ii) delay in taking action under this chapter would cause damage to that industry that would be difficult to repair.
(B) If the determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and
(ii) are affirmative, the Commission shall find the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or rem- edy the serious injury. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall give preference to increasing or imposing a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.
(C) The Commission shall immediately report to the Presi- dent its determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) and, if the determinations are affirmative, the finding under sub- paragraph (B).
(D) Within 30 days after receiving a report from the Com- mission under subparagraph (C) containing an affirmative de- termination under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii), the President, if he considers provisional relief to be warranted and after tak- ing into account the finding of the Commission under subpara- graph (B), shall proclaim, for a period not to exceed 200 days, such provisional relief that the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. Such relief shall take the form of an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty on im- ports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.
(3) If provisional relief is proclaimed under paragraph (1)(G) or (2)(D) in the form of an increase, or the imposition of, a duty, the President shall order the suspension of liquidation of all imported articles subject to the affirmative determination under paragraph (1)(C) or paragraph (2)(A), as the case may be, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for con- sumption, on or after the date of the determination.
(4)(A) Any provisional relief implemented under this sub- section with respect to an imported article shall terminate on the day on which—
(i) if such relief was proclaimed under paragraph (1)(G) or (2)(D), the Commission makes a negative deter- mination under subsection (b) regarding injury or the threat thereof by imports of such article;
(ii) action described in section 203(a)(3) (A) or (C) takes effect under section 203 with respect to such article; (iii) a decision by the President not to take any action under section 203(a) with respect to such article becomes
final; or
(iv) whenever the President determines that, because
of changed circumstances, such relief is no longer war- ranted.
(B) Any suspension of liquidation ordered under paragraph
(3) with respect to an imported article shall terminate on the day on which provisional relief is terminated under subpara- graph (A) with respect to the article.

(C) If an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty that is proclaimed under section 203 on an imported article is dif- ferent from a duty increase or imposition that was proclaimed for such an article under this section, then the entry of any such article for which liquidation was suspended under para- graph (3) shall be liquidated at whichever of such rates of duty is lower.
(D) If provisional relief in the form of an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty is proclaimed under this section with re- spect to an imported article and neither a duty increase nor a duty imposition is proclaimed under section 203 regarding such article, the entry of any such article for which liquidation was suspended under paragraph (3) may be liquidated at the rate of duty that applied before provisional relief was provided.

(i) any increase in, or imposition of, any duty;
(ii) any modification or imposition of any quan-
titative restriction on the importation of an article into the United States; or

(e) COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS.—
(1) If the Commission makes an affirmative determination
under subsection (b)(1), the Commission shall also recommend the action that would address the serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry and be most effective in facili- tating the efforts of the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.
(2) The Commission is authorized to recommend under paragraph (1)—
(A) an increase in, or the imposition of, any duty on the imported article;

(i) the domestic industry has not made adequate efforts to make a positive adjustment to import com- petition, or
(ii) the effectiveness of the action taken under sec- tion 203 has been impaired by changed economic cir- cumstances,
that changed circumstances warrant such reduction, or termination; or

(C) it provides that amounts received by the recipient cor- poration from the qualified trust for qualified employer securi- ties purchased for the purpose of this subsection will be used exclusively by the recipient corporation for those purposes for which it may use that portion of the loan paid directly to it by the lender,
(D) it provides that the recipient corporation may not re- duce the amount of its equity capital during the one year pe- riod beginning on the date on which the qualified trust pur- chases qualified employer securities for purposes of this sub- section, and

(3) The Commission shall report to the President its deter- mination with respect to each investigation under paragraph (1) and the basis therefor and shall include in each report any dis- senting or separate views. If the Commission finds, as a result of its investigation, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, it shall find the amount of the increase in, or imposition of, any duty or other import re- striction on such article which is necessary to prevent or remedy such market disruption and shall include such finding in its report to the President. The Commission shall furnish to the President a transcript of the hearings and any briefs which may have been sub- mitted in connection with each investigation.
(4) The report of the Commission of its determination with re- spect to an investigation under paragraph (1) shall be made at the earliest practicable time, but not later than 3 months after the date on which the petition is filed (or the date on which the request or resolution is received or the motion is adopted, as the case may be). Upon making such report to the President, the Commission shall also promptly make public such report (with the exception of infor- mation which the Commission determines to be confidential) and shall cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Reg- ister.

except that—
(A) the President may take action under such sections 202 and 203 only with respect to imports from the country or countries involved of the article with respect to which the affirmative determination was made; and
(B) if such action consists of, or includes, an orderly marketing agreement, such agreement shall be entered into within 60 days after the import relief determination date.

(2) If the President determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of such article, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall initiate consultations with such country with respect to such imports.
(e) For purposes of this section—
(1) The term ‘‘Communist country’’ means any country
dominated or controlled by communism.
(2)(A) Market disruption exists within a domestic industry
whenever imports of an article, like or directly competitive with an article produced by such domestic industry, are in- creasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant cause of material injury, or threat thereof, to such domestic industry.
(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A):
(i) Imports of an article shall be considered to be in-
creasing rapidly if there has been a significant increase in such imports (either actual or relative to domestic produc- tion) during a recent period of time.
(ii) The term ‘‘significant cause’’ refers to a cause which contributes significantly to the material injury of the domestic industry, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause.
(C) The Commission, in determining whether market dis-
ruption exists, shall consider, among other factors—
(i) the volume of imports of the merchandise which is
the subject of the investigation;
(ii) the effect of imports of the merchandise on prices
in the United States for like or directly competitive arti- cles;

CHAPTER 2—RELIEF FROM MARKET DISRUP- TION TO INDUSTRIES AND DIVERSION OF TRADE TO THE UNITED STATES MARKET
SEC. 421. ACTION TO ADDRESS MARKET DISRUPTION.
(a) PRESIDENTIAL ACTION.—If a product of the People’s Repub- lic of China is being imported into the United States in such in- creased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of a like or directly competitive product, the President shall, in accordance with the provisions of this section, proclaim increased duties or other import restrictions with respect to such product, to the extent and for such period as the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the market disruption.
(b) INITIATION OF AN INVESTIGATION.—(1) Upon the filing of a petition by an entity described in section 202(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252(a)), upon the request of the President or the United States Trade Representative (in this chapter referred to as the ‘‘Trade Representative’’), upon resolution of either the Com- mittee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, or the Committee on Finance of the Senate (in this chapter referred to as the ‘‘Committees’’) or on its own motion, the United States Inter- national Trade Commission (in this chapter referred to as the ‘‘Commission’’) shall promptly make an investigation to determine whether products of the People’s Republic of China are being im- ported into the United States in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly competitive products.
(2) The limitations on investigations set forth in section 202(h)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252(h)(1)) shall apply to investigations conducted under this section.

(5) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold public hearings at which the Commission shall afford interested parties an oppor- tunity to be present, to present evidence, to respond to the presen- tations of other parties, and otherwise to be heard.
(c) MARKET DISRUPTION.—(1) For purposes of this section, mar- ket disruption exists whenever imports of an article like or directly competitive with an article produced by a domestic industry are in- creasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a sig- nificant cause of material injury, or threat of material injury, to the domestic industry.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term ‘‘significant cause’’ refers to a cause which contributes significantly to the material in- jury of the domestic industry, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause.
(d) FACTORS IN DETERMINATION.—In determining whether mar- ket disruption exists, the Commission shall consider objective fac- tors, including—
(1) the volume of imports of the product which is the sub- ject of the investigation;
(2) the effect of imports of such product on prices in the United States for like or directly competitive articles; and
(3) the effect of imports of such product on the domestic in- dustry producing like or directly competitive articles.
The presence or absence of any factor under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) is not necessarily dispositive of whether market disruption ex- ists.
(e) TIME FOR COMMISSION DETERMINATIONS.—The Commission shall make and transmit to the President and the Trade Represent- ative its determination under subsection (b)(1) at the earliest prac- ticable time, but in no case later than 60 days (or 90 days in the case of a petition requesting relief under subsection (i)) after the date on which the petition is filed, the request or resolution is re- ceived, or the motion is adopted, under subsection (b). If the Com- missioners voting are equally divided with respect to its determina- tion, then the determination agreed upon by either group of Com- missioners may be considered by the President and the Trade Rep- resentative as the determination of the Commission.
(f) RECOMMENDATIONS OF COMMISSION ON PROPOSED REM- EDIES.—If the Commission makes an affirmative determination under subsection (b), or a determination which the President or the Trade Representative may consider as affirmative under subsection (e), the Commission shall propose the amount of increase in, or im- position of, any duty or other import restrictions necessary to pre- vent or remedy the market disruption. Only those members of the Commission who agreed to the affirmative determination under subsection (b) are eligible to vote on the proposed action to prevent or remedy market disruption. Members of the Commission who did not agree to the affirmative determination may submit, in the re-

(2) The President may determine under paragraph (1) that pro- viding import relief is not in the national economic interest of the United States only if the President finds that the taking of such action would have an adverse impact on the United States economy clearly greater than the benefits of such action.
